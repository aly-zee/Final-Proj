# Final-Proj


In the fast-paced world of retail, understanding consumer behavior and market trends is crucial for staying competitive and maximizing profitability. This retail dataset provides information on demographics of customers from the US, Canada, and Europe. 

By harnessing the power of data, the goal is to empower retail stakeholders—from marketers to merchandisers and executives —with the knowledge needed to make informed, data-driven decisions that drive growth and foster customer loyalty.

By exploring the data and applying the K-Means clustering algorithm on the dataset distinct clusters are uncovered that provide valuable insights for segmentation and targeted business strategies.
